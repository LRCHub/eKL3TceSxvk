```lrc
[00:15.89] I'm scared
[00:20.89] 
[00:21.69] It feels like you don't care
[00:35.69] 
[00:28.87] Enlighten me, my dear
[00:39.37] 
[00:36.31] Why am I still here?
[00:46.31] 
[00:43.34] I don't mean to be complacent with the decisions you made
[00:51.82] But why?
[00:56.11] Mm
[00:57.11] 
[00:58.59] In the back of my mind
[01:02.10] You died
[01:05.25] And I didn't even cry
[01:08.66] No, not a single tear
[01:12.45] And I'm sick of waiting patiently for someone that won't even arrive
[01:46.45] 
[01:29.06] Whoa
[01:31.06] 
[01:42.29] In the back of my mind
[01:45.82] I killed you
[01:48.92] And I didn't even even regret it
[01:52.93] I can't believe I said it
[01:56.58] But it's true
[02:03.08] 
[02:04.03] I hate you
